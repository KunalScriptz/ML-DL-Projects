    "- **Radio**: Money spent on the radio marketing (in thousands of dollars)\n",

    "#### 💡 Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are assuming **Sales** is measured in **USD (thousands)**.\n",
    "- The ad spending columns are also in **thousands of USD**.\n",
    "- Since it is an advertising dataset, it tracks how money spent on **TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads** affects **sales**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 Objective\n",
    "\n",
