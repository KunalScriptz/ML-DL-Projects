## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-DL-Projects.git
cd ML-DL-Projects
```

### 2. Set Up Environment using `uv`

Ensure you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed. If not, [install it first](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation).

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv create ml-dl-env
uv venv activate ml-dl-env
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: Individual projects may have specific dependencies listed separately within their folders.

## 🎯 Usage

Navigate into any specific project directory to find detailed instructions in their respective `README.md` files.
